# Smart_IT_Cafetaria
This a java project named ‘Smart IT Cafeteria’, a part of my 3rd semester Object Oriented Programming course of my BSc. Engineering program. It was a digitalized restaurant management system for IT Cafeteria of University of Chittagong to make ordering food, getting receipt and storing employees details easier, faster and smarter. Basically, my role was of a programmer in this project. A detail report on this project is described below:

# Introduction:
This project introduces us a new era of restaurant management. Simply, a digitalized way of serving the customer , counting cost of foods(including VAT), managing the information of employees. It also provides a smarter way to the customer to select their desired items from a digitalized menu , which makes our cafeteria one step smarter and easier to the authority and also to the customers.

# Purpose of Our Project :
- → The main purpose of our project is to give a smarter and easier way to a restaurant manager to perform his duty perfectly and saving his valuable time . 
- → Other purpose of our project is to make the customers feel comfort while selecting their meal and paying their bill. 
- → To make the whole system fair. (as the cost are counted digitally , their will be almost no question of corruption)

# Project Requirements:
- • Excellence in Modern Java.
- • Enough knowledge in MySQL.

# Tools Used:
- 1. Netbeans8.2 IDE
- 2.JDK 1.8.0
- 3.XAMPP for database’s server

# Advantages:
- Easy to use, little training needed.
- Decreased human error
- Automatic bill calculation
- Order is input to system as fast as possible
- 
# Disadvantages:
- Training costs
– Instillation and system costs
- System Maintenance

# Application in Real Life:
The world is getting more digitalized day by day and Bangladesh is also walking on the way of digitalization. Digitalization makes our daily life easier, smoother an faster. So our restaurants and cafeterias should also be digitalized. Here, the advantages of the project are more than the
disadvantages. So all the restaurants and cafetaria can adapt this software for getting faster and easiar management system.

# Future Aspects:
In future , our project could be further enhanced by providing following features :
- 1. The workers will be monitored by a smarter way. Their salary will be given by considering their exact working hour per day. After adding this feature we guarantee no workers will be able to play false with their work .
- 2. We will provide the customers the feature of home delivery.
- 3.Admin will also can add or remove food item from menu.
The inclusion of these feature would surely make our project highly demanding and would be grand success in practical field.

# Conclusion:
It has been a matter of immense pleasure, honour and challenge to have this opportunity to take up this project and complete it successfully. While developing this project we’ve learned a lot about building a successful Java project and how to make it user friendly by hiding the complicated parts of it from the user.During the development process we studied carefully and understood the necessity of maintaining a minimal margin for error.
